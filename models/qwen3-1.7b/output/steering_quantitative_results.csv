First, I should mention the historical context. Max Planck introduced quantization in 1900, which was a departure from classical physics. Then Einstein's photoelectric effect, Bohr's model of the atom, and Schrödinger's wave equation. These milestones laid the groundwork for quantum mechanics.

I need to highlight key concepts: wave-particle duality, quantization of energy, uncertainty principle, superposition, entanglement, and quantization of angular momentum. Each of these concepts is crucial and often misunderstood.

Okay, the user is asking me to explain quantum mechanics. I need to make sure I cover the basics but also avoid being too technical. Let me start by recalling the fundamental concepts. Quantum mechanics is a theoretical framework that describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. But I should explain it in a way that's accessible.
