This absorbed light energy is used to drive the chemical reactions of photosynthesis.\n\n2. **Light-Dependent Reactions**:  \n   These reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.  \n   - Light energy is used to split water molecules (H\u2082O) into oxygen (O\u2082), protons (H\u207a), and electrons.  \n   - The electrons move through a series",

This process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain the pigment chlorophyll that captures sunlight and uses it to drive the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen as a byproduct.
