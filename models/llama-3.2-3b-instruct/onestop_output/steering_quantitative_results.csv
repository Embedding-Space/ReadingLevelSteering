It is a very different way of thinking about the world compared to classical physics, which is used to describe the behavior of everyday objects like balls and people.

**Key Principles of Quantum Mechanics:**

1. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Quantum objects can behave like both waves and particles. This is because they can have different properties like position and energy, which are not always well-defined at the same time.
2. **Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to know certain properties of a quantum object, like position and speed, at the same time with infinite precision.

2. **Uncertainty principle**: It's impossible to precisely know certain properties of a quantum object, like its position and momentum, simultaneously. The more precisely you measure one property, the less precisely you can know the other.
