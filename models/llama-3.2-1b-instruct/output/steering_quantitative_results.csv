**What is quantum mechanics?**

Quantum mechanics is a theoretical framework developed by Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and Werner von Neumann in the early 20th century. It postulates that fundamental entities, such as particles (like electrons, photons, and quarks), exhibit probabilistic behavior rather than deterministic behavior.

In classical physics, macroscopic phenomena are governed by deterministic principles, whereas quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic aspects inherent in wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and entanglement. Quantum mechanics aims to reconcile classical notions of determinism with probabilistic principles inherent in quantum mechanics.
