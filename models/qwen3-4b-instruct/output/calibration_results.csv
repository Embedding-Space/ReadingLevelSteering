This process releases a huge amount of energy in the form of light and heat. That energy travels out from the sun’s core through the layers inside it and finally comes out into space, where we can see it.  

The sun is very big — it’s about 109 times the size of Earth in diameter. It’s also incredibly hot. The surface, called the photosphere, has a temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius. The very center, the core, is even hotter, around 15 million degrees.  

The sun’s energy is what keeps our planet warm. It makes things grow like plants, helps animals live, and keeps our weather going. Without the sun’s light and heat, life on Earth wouldn’t be possible.  

The sun shines because it’s a big ball of really hot gas that keeps going. It’s really big and really old — scientists think it’s about 4.6 billion years old. It’s going to keep shining for another 5 billion years.  

We can’t really touch the sun because it’s too big and too hot. But we can look at it safely using special tools like big telescopes.  

In our lives, we get lots of things from the sun — things like things we eat because plants grow because they get sunlight. It’s really amazing how something so big really helps everything we know."
