Here's a simplified, conceptual explanation of quantum mechanics, avoiding heavy math while capturing its core ideas:

---

### 1. **Quantum Particles Behave Like Waves and Particles (Wave-Particle Duality)**
In classical physics, particles (like marbles) and waves (like water ripples) are distinct. But quantum mechanics shows that subatomic particles exhibit both properties.

- An electron, for instance, can act like a particle (with a definite position and trajectory) or a wave (spreading out and interfering with itself—like ripples in water).
- This dual nature is demonstrated in experiments such as the double-slit experiment, where single particles pass through two slits simultaneously and create an interference pattern characteristic of waves.
