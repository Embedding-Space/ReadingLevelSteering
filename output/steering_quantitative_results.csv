### 🌐 Origins: The Cold War and Early Research (1950s–1960s)

The Internet did not start as a global network. It began as a project driven by military and academic needs during the Cold War.

- **1950s – The Need for Resilience**:  
  During the Cold War, the U.S. government worried about the vulnerability of communication systems. If a nuclear attack destroyed traditional infrastructure (like phone lines), communication would be lost.  
  This led to the idea of a **""network of networks""** — a system where messages could be routed around damaged parts.

Over time, it expanded to include more institutions.  
In the 1970s, the development of TCP/IP protocols allowed different networks to communicate with each other. This was a crucial step in the creation of the Internet. TCP/IP enabled data to be broken into packets and sent across different networks.
